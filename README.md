# Hotel Booking Analysis

# 1.1 Problem Statement
In the dynamic and competitive hospitality industry, understanding customer behavior and preferences is crucial for the success of any hotel business. This analysis focuses on differentiating booking patterns and customer preferences between two types of hotels: a city hotel (H2) and a resort hotel (H1). The aim is to understand how various factors, such as lead time, stay duration, and time of the year, influence booking behaviors, which is vital for hotel managers and stakeholders to tailor their services and marketing strategies effectively.

# 1.2 Approach to Address the Problem
To address this problem, we will utilize a dataset containing booking information for both a city hotel and a resort hotel. This analysis involves:
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting an in-depth analysis to uncover patterns and trends in booking data, focusing on cancellation trends, booking lead time, seasonal trends, length of stay, and guest composition.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing patterns between the city hotel and resort hotel to understand differing customer behaviors.

# 1.3 Proposed Analytic Techniques
Our analytic approach will employ several techniques, including:
- **Trend Analysis**: Observing how bookings and cancellations trend over time.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between lead time, length of stay, and cancellation rates.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Contrasting the city hotel and resort hotel data to highlight unique patterns in each.
- **Cluster Analysis (Optional)**: Segmenting customers based on booking patterns and demographics, if applicable.

# 1.4 Consumer Benefit
The analysis will provide actionable insights to help:
- **Reduce Cancellation Rates**: Understanding predictors of cancellations to devise strategies for reduction.
- **Tailor Marketing Efforts**: Recognizing peak booking periods and typical guest profiles for targeted promotions.
- **Resource Allocation**: Predicting busy periods for better management of staffing and inventory.
- **Customize Guest Experiences**: Enhancing personalization in services by understanding guest preferences.

This analysis aims to turn data into actionable strategies in the hotel industry, ensuring that our findings are not only comprehensive but also directly relevant to key operational areas.
